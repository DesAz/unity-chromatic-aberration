# Unity Chromatic Aberration
A post-processing shader to use the chromatic aberration effect on Unity camera. 
Works on all rendered scene or just on the edges of the screen, like a vignette.

It's a simple shader, I tried to optimize as much as I could, if you want something more sofisticated I recommend use the [Unity post processing](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing).
